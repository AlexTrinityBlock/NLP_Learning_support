## recommendation I get from linkedin
Google Translation: 
```
Hi, I see your article on Iron Man
Feel very good writing, although I am now a Web Developer
But the data chain that I studied at the institute previously also uses Python to handle ML, data mining, etc.

Your article made me impulsive and wanted to return to Python, and looked at your article to return to practice

Hope to establish a relationship with you:)
